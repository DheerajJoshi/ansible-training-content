        - class_notes: |
            Configuration files accept configuration directives to modify
            the way Ansible runs, for example: configuring a specific 
            connection type, or to set the number of forks.

        - h3: File locations
        - ul:
          - "ansible.cfg (in the current directory)"
          - ".ansible.cfg (in the home directory)"
          - "/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg"
        - class_notes: |
            These are the three locations where configuration files are kept.
            The configuration files in these locations are read and evaluated
            in an order of precedence.  The system file in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
            has the lowest precedence, the "~/.ansible.cfg" is next highest, and
            "./ansible.cfg" is the highest precedence.

            ANSIBLE_KEEP_ALL_FILES=True ansible -i hosts ...
        - class_notes: |
            Environment variables have the highest precedence of all, and work similarly
            to configuration directives in config files

            - "Enviroment variables & configuration directives"
            - constants.py
        - class_notes: |
            An enviroment variable is going to squash configuration directives
            at all levels.  Important to note: enviroment variables do not always
            have an equivalent configuration directive.
            Enviroment variables are not well documented, and are, for the most part
            documented only in code, in the "constants.py" file inside Ansible

        - h3: Configuration Sections
        - ul:
            - defaults
            - paramiko
            - ssh_connection
            - accelerate
        - class_notes: |
            Each of the bullets are a "section" under which their respective directives
            should be used.  The config file uses INI format.

      -
        - h3: Configuration Sections
        - code: |
            $ cat ansible.cfg
            [defaults]
            ...
        - class_notes: |
            Sections are literally section headers for INI files. Configuration
            directives for each section are placed under their appropriate,
            respective section header.

      -
        - h3: Configuration Options
        - p: Each section has its own directives
        - code: |
            [defaults]
            hostfile = hosts
            private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
            ...
        - class_notes: |
            The directives are defined under their respective section.
            The Ansible documentation provides all the configuration directives
            for each section.

            [defaults]
            hostfile = hosts
            private_key_file = /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa
            nocows = 1
            forks = 50
            transport = ssh
            remote_user = ansibleuser
            ask_sudo_pass = True
            ask_vault_pass = True
            roles_path = roles
            
            [ssh_connection]
            pipelining = True
            scp_if_ssh = True
        - class_notes: |
            This is configuration file that was made to ensure Ansible complies
            with the local environment configuration.  For example, it explictly 
            forces ssh, asks for a sudo pass, sets forks to 50, etc.
